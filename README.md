## Disease Spread Simulation and Prediction

## Overview

This project implements a simulation and prediction model for the spread of a contagious disease within a population. The simulation utilizes agent-based modeling techniques to simulate interactions between individuals and the transmission of the disease. Additionally, the model incorporates machine learning algorithms to predict the future spread of the disease based on historical data and various factors.

The goal of the project is to study the dynamics of disease spread, assess the effectiveness of different intervention strategies (such as vaccination, social distancing, and quarantine), and provide insights for public health decision-making.
